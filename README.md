## OVERVIEW

**Pharma Logistics BI** is a comprehensive pharmaceutical supply chain management dashboard built with Power BI. It provides real-time visibility into orders, transportation, inventory, quality compliance, and financial performance across multiple regions and logistics providers.

Designed for supply chain managers, logistics coordinators, and financial analysts to monitor KPIs, identify bottlenecks, and optimize pharmaceutical distribution operations.

### DATA FOUNDATION & GOVERNANCE

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade data engineering practices applied to pharmaceutical supply chain analytics:

**Dataset Engineering:**

- Source: Entire dataset designed and architected from scratch following industry best practices
- Data Layer: Imported into SQL Server 2019+ for rigorous transformation and validation using constraints and relationships
- Upstream Processing: All data cleansing, enrichment, and quality validations are performed at the SQL layer before reaching Power BI. Following the principle: "Perform data transformations as far upstream (close to the source) as possible, and only downstream (in the report) when necessary" (Roche's Maxim). This ensures data integrity, maintains a single source of truth, and optimizes report performance.

- Standardized validation rules applied during ETL
- 13 data tables with 20 active relationships (star schema architecture)
- 302 calculated measures for consistent KPI definitions
This upstream-first approach guarantees data integrity across 822,000+ records spanning 4 regions, 44 countries, 44 warehouses, and 2,535 customers globally.
