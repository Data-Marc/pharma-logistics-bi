## Calculation Methodology

### Top-Level Calculations:
- **OTIF % = (Orders On-Time × Orders In-Full) / Total Orders × 100**
- **Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100**
- **Logistics Cost % = (Transport + Warehouse + Holding) / Revenue × 100**
- **Supply Chain Efficiency = Weighted average of: OTIF, Quality, Cost metrics**
- **Perfect Order % = OTIF % × Quality % × Documentation % / 100²**

### Aggregation:
- Daily calculations from transaction data
- Weekly and monthly rolling averages
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Regional and carrier breakdowns
- Trend analysis with forecasting
